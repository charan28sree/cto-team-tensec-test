<p><strong>Welcome.</strong> This member-only blog is where we’ll publish practical cybersecurity guidance, short lab notes, and threat-aware checklists — written for people who want to build real defensive habits without the hype.</p>

<h2>What you’ll find here</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Actionable security tips</strong> (things you can do today)</li>
  <li><strong>Threat model thinking</strong> (what matters for your actual risk)</li>
  <li><strong>Tooling recommendations</strong> (password managers, passkeys, MFA, backups)</li>
  <li><strong>Lightweight incident response</strong> (what to do when something feels “off”)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How member-only works</h2>
<p>This blog is intended to be visible <strong>only to logged-in members</strong>. Posts are published normally, but they’re categorized and tagged so the site can reliably enforce access control.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Category:</strong> Members Only</li>
  <li><strong>Tag:</strong> member-only</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ground rules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We’ll prioritize <strong>defensive, ethical</strong> guidance.</li>
  <li>No “magic bullet” claims. We’ll call out trade-offs and limitations.</li>
  <li>If you’re unsure what to do first: enable MFA, use a password manager, and keep devices patched.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for being here. Start with the next post for quick security wins you can knock out in under 30 minutes.</p>
