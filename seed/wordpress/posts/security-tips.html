<p>Security is often about <strong>boring consistency</strong>, not perfection. Here are five high-impact steps that reduce risk quickly.</p>

<h2>1) Turn on MFA (prefer app/passkey over SMS)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Enable MFA on your email account first — it’s the reset key for everything else.</li>
  <li>If available, use <strong>passkeys</strong> or an authenticator app.</li>
  <li>Avoid SMS when you have better options (SIM swaps are real).</li>
</ul>

<h2>2) Use a password manager (and rotate the worst offenders)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pick one reputable manager and commit to it.</li>
  <li>Start by changing passwords for: email, banking, cloud storage, and your primary social accounts.</li>
  <li>Use <strong>unique</strong>, randomly generated passwords everywhere.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3) Patch aggressively (especially browsers + OS)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Enable automatic updates for your OS and browser.</li>
  <li>Remove unused apps/extensions — fewer moving parts, fewer vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4) Verify backups (a backup you haven’t tested doesn’t exist)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keep at least one offline or “immutable” copy if possible.</li>
  <li>Test a restore of a single file today (10 minutes now can save days later).</li>
</ul>

<h2>5) Add a phishing speed bump</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Before clicking a link, ask: <em>"What is this trying to get me to do?"</em></li>
  <li>For important accounts, navigate by typing the site manually or using a bookmark.</li>
  <li>If a message creates urgency, assume it’s a trap until verified.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bonus: device encryption + screen lock</h2>
<p>If your laptop/phone is lost or stolen, encryption + a strong lock screen prevents “physical access = game over.” Enable full-disk encryption and set a non-trivial PIN/passcode.</p>
